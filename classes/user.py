User Database Model
==================

This module defines the User model for the gamification platform.
Users can register, login, and participate in various platform activities.

The User model stores:
- Unique username (max 20 characters)
- Hashed password (up to 1100 characters to accommodate various hashing algorithms)
- Auto-incrementing ID as primary key

Note: The password field was previously incorrectly set as unique, which has been fixed.
Multiple users can have the same password (though not recommended for security).
